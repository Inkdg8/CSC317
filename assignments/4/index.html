            Description: Greetings! I am Angel Sandoval, a student at San Francisco State University. I am currently in my senior year at SFSU. I came to SFSU to major in computer science. I was always fascinated by how video games worked. So when I learned I can become a coder and write my own games, I decided to focus on computer science. Yet, my experience with it is limited. I only truly started to code about a year ago. The only language I know is Java as I used it on the IDE:Intellij. I strive to be able to create games that not only I like but others do as well. Along side that, Being able to work at home/anywhere would be nice. So I would not have to worry about vacations/lack of them. My hobby is playing video games.

            Description: I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and the highest completed level of education is high school. I chose Computer Science because the industry interests me, and I believe it is the future going forward.The growing potential and overall expanse of Computer Science truly appealed to me. My father worked in the Air Force and had top secret clearance, so once I graduate, I am thinking of working for the government and possibly the CIA.
